//Q-14: Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.
var guests = ["Areeba", "Amna", "Eman"];
guests.forEach(function (guest) {
    console.log("Dear ".concat(guest, ", Would you like to join me for dinner?"));
});
